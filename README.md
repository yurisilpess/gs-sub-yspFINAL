## Project Overview

This project is a showcase of a personal portfolio, designed to highlight skills, projects, and achievements. It's hosted on GitHub Pages, providing an easy and accessible way for potential employers or collaborators to explore the work.

## Features

- **Theme Customization**: Users can change the theme of the website, but this feature is currently limited to the main page (Home). This allows for a personalized browsing experience, reflecting the user's preferences.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Portfolio Section**: A dedicated section to display projects and achievements. Each project includes a brief description, technologies used, and links to the repository or live version, if available.

- **Contact Form**: An easy way for visitors to get in touch. Messages sent through the contact form are directly forwarded to the owner's email.

## How to Change the Theme

1. Navigate to the Home page.
2. Look for the theme toggle switch located at the top of the page.
3. Click on the toggle to switch between light and dark mode.

Please note that the theme change is only applied to the Home page as of the current version.

## Future Updates

- Extend theme customization to all pages.
- Add a blog section for sharing insights and updates.
- Implement a more dynamic portfolio section with filtering capabilities based on technology or project type.
